Hi, this is an add-on for home-assistant for controlling your IR devices such as TV, video proj, etc... using LIRC and this kind off USB device based on Tiqiaa TView IR transceiver:

You can find them on aliexpress and maybe somewhere else.
Thanks https://github.com/cclairmont/tiqiaa_lirc for the driver.

For now, if you want to use this add-on, you need to fork this repo and change some things to your needs.
You will have to change:
- usb device path in several files
- make a config file for LIRC fitting you needs (exemple in lircd.cond.d, "salon" and "chambre")

In order to get proper value for my virtual remotes, i've used a smartphone with a ir beamer and this app () that allow me to extract a value file for buttons
